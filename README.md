## 🔑 Password Test Results

| Password Type   | Crack Time   | Strength Level | Feedback |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Very Weak        | Instantly     | Very Weak      | Too short and predictable. Lacks uppercase, symbols, and length. |
| Weak             | Few minutes   | Weak           | Slightly better with uppercase or symbol. Still predictable. |
| Strong           | Years         | Strong         | Good mix of characters. Secure for most use cases. |
| Very Strong      | Centuries     | Very Strong    | Long, random, and complex. Extremely secure. |

## 🛡 Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use at least *12 characters*
- Combine *uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters*
- Avoid using personal info or common words
- Use *password managers* to store complex passwords
- Prefer *passphrases* for strong and memorable options

---

## 💬 What I Learned

- Longer passwords are harder to crack
- Complexity significantly increases crack time
- Online tools help in evaluating password strength
- Brute force and dictionary attacks can easily crack weak passwords
- Strong passwords are critical for account security
